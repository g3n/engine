# G3N - Go 3D Game Engine

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/g3n/engine?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/g3n/engine)

G3N is a basic (for now!) OpenGL 3D game engine written in Go.
G3N was heavily inspired and based on the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) Javascript 3D library.

### **To see G3N in action try the [G3N demo](https://github.com/g3n/g3nd).**

## Dependencies

The engine needs an OpenGL driver installed in the system and on Unix like systems
depends on some C libraries that can be installed using the distribution package manager.
In all cases it is necessary to have a gcc compatible C compiler installed.

* For Ubuntu/Debian-like Linux distributions, install the following packages:
  * `xorg-dev`
  * `libgl1-mesa-dev`
  * `libopenal1`
  * `libopenal-dev`
  * `libvorbis0a`
  * `libvorbis-dev`
  * `libvorbisfile3`
* For CentOS/Fedora-like Linux distributions, install the following packages:
  * `xorg-x11-devel.x86_64`
  * `mesa-libGL.x86_64`
  * `mesa-libGL-devel.x86_64`
  * `openal-soft.x86_64`
  * `openal-soft-devel.x86_64`
  * `libvorbis.x86_64`
  * `libvorbis-devel.x86_64`
* For Windows the necessary audio libraries sources and `dlls` are supplied but they need to be installed
  manually. Please see [Audio libraries for Windows](audio/windows) for details.
  We tested the Windows build using the [mingw-w64](https://mingw-w64.org) toolchain.
* On OSX, you should install the development files of OpenAL and Vorbis. If
  your are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as your package manager, run:
  `brew install libvorbis openal-soft`

G3N was only tested with Go1.7.4+

## Installation

The following command will download the engine and all its dependencies, compile and
install the packages. Make sure your GOPATH is set correctly. 

`go get -u github.com/g3n/engine/...`

## Features

* Hierarchical scene graph. Any node can contain other nodes.
* Supports perspective and orthographic cameras. The camera can be controlled
  by the orbit control which allow zooming, rotation and panning using the mouse or keyboard.
* Suports ambient, directional, point and spot lights. Many lights can be added to the scene.
* Generators for primitive geometries such as: lines, box, sphere, cylinder and torus.
* Geometries can support multimaterials.
* Image textures can loaded from GIF, PNG or JPEG files and applied to materials.
* Loaders for the following 3D formats: Obj and Collada
* Text support allowing loading freetype fonts.
* Basic GUI supporting the widgets: label, image, button, checkbox, radiobutton,
  edit, scrollbar, slider, splitter, list, dropdown, tree, folder, window and layout managers
  (horizontal box, vertical box, grid, dock)
* Spatial audio support allowing playing sound from wave or Ogg Vorbis files.
* Users' applications can use their own vertex and fragment shaders.

## Basic application

The following code shows a basic G3N application 
([hellog3n](https://github.com/g3n/demos/tree/master/hellog3n))
which shows a wireframed sphere rotating.
You can install hellog3n using: `go get -u github.com/g3n/demos/hellog3n`

For more complex demos please see the [G3N demo program](https://github.com/g3n/g3nd).

func main() {

	// Creates window and OpenGL context
	wmgr, err := window.Manager("glfw")

	// This normally should be updated if the window is resized.
	width, height := win.Size()
	gs.Viewport(0, 0, int32(width), int32(height))

	// Creates scene for 3D objects
	scene := core.NewNode()

	// Adds white ambient light to the scene
	ambLight := light.NewAmbient(&math32.Color{1.0, 1.0, 1.0}, 0.5)
	scene.Add(ambLight)

	// Adds a perspective camera to the scene
	// The camera aspect ratio should be updated if the window is resized.
	aspect := float32(width) / float32(height)
	camera := camera.NewPerspective(65, aspect, 0.01, 1000)
	camera.SetPosition(0, 0, 5)

	// Add an axis helper to the scene
	axis := graphic.NewAxisHelper(2)
	scene.Add(axis)

	// Creates a wireframe sphere positioned at the center of the scene
	geom := geometry.NewSphere(2, 16, 16, 0, math.Pi*2, 0, math.Pi)
	mat := material.NewStandard(math32.NewColor("White"))
	mat.SetSide(material.SideDouble)
	mat.SetWireframe(true)
	sphere := graphic.NewMesh(geom, mat)
	scene.Add(sphere)

	// Creates a renderer and adds default shaders
	rend := renderer.NewRenderer(gs)
	err = rend.AddDefaultShaders()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	rend.SetScene(scene)

	// Sets window background color
	gs.ClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1.0)

	// Render loop
	for !win.ShouldClose() {

		// Rotates the sphere a bit around the Z axis (up)
		sphere.AddRotationY(0.005)

		// Render the scene using the specified camera
		rend.Render(camera)

		// Update window and checks for I/O events
		win.SwapBuffers()
		wmgr.PollEvents()
	}
}

## To Do

G3N is a basic game engine. There is a lot of things to do.
We will soon insert here a list of the most important missing features.

## Documentation

For the engine API reference, please use
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/g3n/engine?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/g3n/engine).
Currently the best way to learn how to use the engine is to see the source code
of the demos from [G3ND](https://github.com/g3n/g3nd).
We intend to write in the future documentation topics
to build a user guide in the [wiki](https://github.com/g3n/engine/wiki).

## Contributing

If you spot a bug or create a new feature you are encouraged to
send pull requests.
